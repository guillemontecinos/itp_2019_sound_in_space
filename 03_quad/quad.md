# Quadraphonic
My search for this assignment was to set the listener in an immersive sound context by allocating a set of sound sources in space using four channels. For this I used an Ableton Live addon called *XY send nodes* –built in Max for Live– which spatializes a track between *n-channels* represented by send tracks.
