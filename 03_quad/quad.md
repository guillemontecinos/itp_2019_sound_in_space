# Quadraphonic
My search for this assignment was to set the listener in an immersive sound context by allocating a set of sound sources in space using four channels. For this I used an Ableton Live addon called *XY send nodes* –built in Max for Live– which spatializes a track between *n-channels* represented by send tracks.

The sound landscape I created consisted in two water in-site recordings I made back in Chile few years ago, which were placed in opposite corners of the system. On top of these textures I placed a string ensemble in different positions of the space, and a arpeggiated piano which constantly moved among the quad space.
