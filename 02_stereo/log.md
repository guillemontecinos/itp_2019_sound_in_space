* compose in terms of silence
* in traditional music composition process consists in placing a sound source in a context of silence. it means that silence is there by default and is altered because of a sound presence
* i want to compose this piece looking from an exact opposite approach: where noise is the default sonic context over which we place "silence sources", that can be panned in space.
* the main question is how can i pan silence? if i pan a sound placed on the center of a virtual space i should be able to hear the half of the energy on each speaker
