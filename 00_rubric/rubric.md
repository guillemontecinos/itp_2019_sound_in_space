# Rubric Assignment
During this course I pretend to explore the spatialization of sound in terms of design as coding and decoding data, synthesis and modulation, and perception  as acoustic room tuning and corporal vibrations. Probably my assignments will lack of a harmonic, rhythmic and melodic structure –I can't ensure it, but may happen– and the way I expect them to be listened is through corporal and irrational engagement. I know it may sound too vague, but my expectation for this semester is to explore and play, therefore I don't pretend –neither expect– to make a masterpiece.

I expect my work is graded through the following categories:

* Purpose: My goal is to have a purpose in any of my assignments which will be the guide path and the starting point for each one of my explorations. This purpose may be a question or expected result.
* Method: I will define a method whereby to approach the exploration goal, which will be justified.
* Result: I expect the outcome of my work is graded as a result of an experiment, which means there are not good or bad results if I attempted to answer the original question-purpose.
