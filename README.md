# Sound in Space Blog

## Monophonic
The challenge of composing a monophonic piece for a class called *Sound in Space* brought me the question that regarding sound spatial perception is calculated by our brain measuring the difference in time our ears capture sound, *how can I spatialize with only one sound channel?* To afford that I thought that I can make audience feel that sound is spatialized by taking advantage of the physical characteristics of the site where the piece was to be played. So it brought me to the idea of a site-specific piece.

My first approach to that was to bring one speaker to the room, place it in a specific orientation towards the wall and activate it with pure tones –later I realized that it is called *tuning the space*. That experiment resulted into a list of frequencies that made different components of the room vibrate –from racks to tables to my head– and I could use to create the sensation of spatial sound.

  * sound can be detected over **33 hz**
  * head vibration at **51 hz**
  * body/table vibration around **73 hz**
  * floor vibration at **93 hz**
  * rack vibration at **115 hz**
  * other rack vibration at **140 hz**
  * other rack vibration at **155 hz**
  * over **150 hz** it gets annoying
